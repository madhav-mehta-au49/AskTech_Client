              Machine learning has been around for decades, but fueled by emergence of big data, it has started gaining significant traction in digital health. Healthcare providers and payers have seen enormous volumes of both structured and unstructured data, generated through various manual and automated sources: electronic health record systems (EHRs), medical devices, claims and billing systems, and pharma research, to name a few.

              <p className={styles.customTextCopy}>
              The issue of interoperability in private and government healthcare has become one of the chief concerns with the lawmakers, healthcare policy administrators and clinical community. It is one of the gaps in healthcare which was not adequately addressed by the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Physicians continue to be frustrated by their inability to gain access clinical documents in a timely fashion in order to make critical decisions at the bedside and in an ambulatory setting. The recent version of FHIR 3.0 is an important milestone for this emerging technology, which quickly gains support and adoption by major EHR vendors, such as Epic and Cerner, who are now playing a much more active role in shaping the future interoperability landscape. Payers also have a strong interest in collaboration with providers to gain access to the clinical data feeds (ADT, Results, Observations, and Orders). Having access to that data allows them to better optimize their workflows.

              Patients with a range of diseases have been treated for many years using clinical guidelines and methods that are accepted throughout the industry. Personalized medicine has made it possible to use genetic, genomic, and clinical data together to better the results for patients. As gene sequencing technologies like next-generation sequencing have advanced and become more prevalent in academic settings and molecular laboratories, it is now possible to predict an individual’s risk of contracting specific conditions, the course of a disease, and—most importantly—how well drug treatments will interact with genetic biomarkers.

              A number of healthcare stakeholders, including but not limited to Pharma research companies, acute care facilities, community physicians, and payers, are very interested in the topic of personalised medicine. Oncologists, who treat patients with solid tumors, among other medical disciplines, have been heavily utilizing the capabilities of genetic and molecular testing. To demonstrate this argument, consider the fact that recent research indicates that at least 10 critical biomarkers are associated with more than half of patients with non-small cell lung cancer. This information enables oncologists to use molecular profiling in conjunction with evidence-based therapy information.

              Software developers have been exploring for innovative and effective methods to employ portable devices in healthcare since the mid-1990s with the arrival of those devices’ expanded capabilities. One of the most obvious use cases is expanding an EHR’s data viewing and entry capabilities to a clinician’s mobile device. Positive patient identification, laboratory results verification, test ordering, charge recording, and clinical notes all sounded like no-brainier disruptive concepts. However, as the mHealth sector matured and gained traction with vendors, hospitals, and individual providers, particularly with the advent of medicine, it became increasingly clear that these great benefits also impose a variety of challenges on mobile developers, including technical, regulatory, workflow usability, and performance issues. Our mHealth clients’ success stories confirm this, as well.
